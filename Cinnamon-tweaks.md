# Cinnamon Desktop tweaks

## Install additional themes

* Be aware that the "overall appearance" is a bit of a moot point in GTK(3), as various visuals have to be 
  configured individually, i.e. window decorations, control styles, desktop theme etc. Therefore, some work
  is generally required to install and enable the desired appearance traits.
* Install ocs-store for easier access to themes:
    * Install `appimagelauncher` via AUR
    * Start `appimagelauncherd` in a terminal and leave it running
    * Go to <https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1175480>, download the ocs-store and the running AppImageLauncher will
      automatically install the ocs-store app. The process takes a few moments to complete
    * Start `ocs-store` from terminal or menu and use it to search for and install desired stuff under the 
    `Linux/Unix Desktops -> Gnome/GTK -> GTK3 themes`. Similar procedure for desktops, icons, cursors etc.  
* Now launch `Themes` from the menu and set the individual components as desired.
* Themes that _are more visually appealing than the default Adwaita nonsense_:
    * Ultimate Dark (with whatever accent color you prefer)
    * Win10 - gives an appearance very close to original Windows 10
